# HousePricePrediction

This project involves predictions of house prices using various regression techniques like - ‘Multiple Linear Regression’, ‘Polynomial Regression’, ‘Random Forest Regression’. This system assists in determining a beginning price for a property based on neighborhood. This strategy will assist people in putting money into a bequest without using a broker. According to the findings of this study, the Random Forest Regression model provides the highest level of accuracy and the least root mean square error (RMSE) value.


- Dataset used for regression models is kc_house_data.csv

- The code to run this project is SL_project.ipynb

- Remember to change the location of the csv file in line [3] and then run all lines.
